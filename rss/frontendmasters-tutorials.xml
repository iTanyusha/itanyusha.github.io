        <description><![CDATA[The term “DOM Blaster” is not official in any way, I just felt like naming it something silly. The idea is that when you use an `@scope {}` block inside a `<style>` block placed somewhere in the DOM the implied scope is the parent element. This means you can style an element (and it’s descendants) with regular CSS without having to name it or otherwise select it at all. This is immediately useful, but might have bigger implications on how we style sites going forward.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.frontendmasters.com/assets/tutorials/coyier/dom-blasters/thumb-270.webp" /><br><br>Duration: 12 min<br><br>Authors: Chris Coyier]]></description>

        <link>https://frontendmasters.com/tutorials/chris-coyier/proximity-scope/</link>
        <description><![CDATA[Proximity scope is a feature of `@scope` in CSS. While resolving a selector within an `@scope () {}` at-rule, selectors with the same specificity will rely on DOM proximity to decide a winner above what would have otherwise been source order. This is a whole new step in the cascade for CSS. It’s a bit niche of a concern, but it actually can make CSS work more intuitively, fixing an issue where an obviously closer class is losing to another class just because of the order they appear in the CSS.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.frontendmasters.com/assets/tutorials/coyier/proximity-scope/thumb-270.webp" /><br><br>Duration: 10 min<br><br>Authors: Chris Coyier]]></description>

It’s written like `@scope (article.card) to (.content) {}`. The effect is like you’re selecting an area with a hole in it, like a donut.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.frontendmasters.com/assets/tutorials/coyier/donut-scope/thumb-270.webp" /><br><br>Duration: 14 min<br><br>Authors: Chris Coyier]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[While centering a div is often the focus of a lot of memes about how hard it can be, with modern CSS, we might have reached the point where we have too many ways to center a div.
But, w e can actually learn a lot about how CSS works by breaking down the options that we do have, so today, we’ll see a lot of ways to do the exact same thing, but we’ll learn a ton of useful things along the way as well, and hopefully also help build up some critical thinking skills too, because centering divs isn’t the only thing in CSS where you can accomplish the same thing in different ways, but often the actual use case can dictate which is best, so we’ll talk about that as we go through it too.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.frontendmasters.com/assets/tutorials/powell/centering-a-div/thumb-270.webp" /><br><br>Duration: 18 min<br><br>Authors: Kevin Powell]]></description>
